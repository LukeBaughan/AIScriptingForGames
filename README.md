# AI Behaviours

In this university project, I was tasked with setting up AI behaviours which could be used in games such as seeking a target, evading a target, group movement, wandering and more.
<br />  I also set up an A* pathfinding behaviour in addition to a decision-making enemy which would change its behaviour based on its situation.
<br /> I then created a foundation for simple Vampire Survivors style game, incorporating some of the AI behaviours I previously made.
<br /> <br /> My scripts can be found in Assets->Scripts->Lukeâ€™s Scripts (All other content is provided by Staffordshire University)
